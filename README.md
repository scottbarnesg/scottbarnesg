#### Hi, I'm Scott.

I'm a software engineer who enjoys designing and implementing novel systems. 
I do my best work on applied R&D projects or greenfield projects in which I and my team have significant autonomy.

#### Professional Work

Here's a few examples of the work I've done professionally:

- Lead the design and development of a novel geosptatial analysis system, STIRE (Space-Time Intelligence & Reasoning Engine), from the idea phase to production. 
  - STIRE leverages spacetimehashing and machine learning to automate frequently encountered geospatial analysis tasks that have traditionally required human review.
  - STIRE provides advanced geospatial analytics for [Black Cape's Rubicon offering](https://blackcape.io/products/rubicon)

- Develop full stack, application, and system software for a robust Positioning, Navigation, & Timing (PNT) system.
  - Designed & developed novel software service to steer a clock at nanosecond precision with full redundancy based on statistical confidence in source signals.
  - Identified bottlenecks in geolocation engine algorithms & implemented improvements, reducing computation time by ~20%.
  - Developed multi-tiered cache and pubsub system for ingesting live data, reducing staleness by ~30%.

- Principal Investigator on internal R&D program, 
  - Lead a team of engineers to successfully develop [a prototype system for identifying and tracking small unmanned air systems](https://www.rtx.com/News/2020/04/03/Aviation-2030).
  - Generated multiple patents.

#### Patents and Papers
